    <h2>What is HTML5?</h2>
    <p id="cuatro">HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.</p>

    <h2>What's so great about HTML5?</h2>
    <p id="cuatro">TML5 has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd want to do online without requiring additional software such as browser plugins. It does everything from animation to apps, music to movies, and can also be used to build incredibly complicated applications that run in your browser.There's more. HTML5 isn't proprietary, so you don't need to pay royalties to use it. It's also cross-platform, which means it doesn't care whether you're using a tablet or a smartphone, a netbook, notebook or ultrabook or a Smart TV: if your browser supports HTML5, it should work flawlessly. Inevitably, it's a bit more complicated than that. More about that in a moment.</p>

    <h2>What tools do I need to create HTML5 websites?</h2>
    <p id="cuatro">Purists would say that you don't need any tools - you can write HTML5 code with a biro and a bit of paper if you wish - but others prefer tools such as Adobe's Dreamweaver, which gained an HTML5 pack in 2010. Adobe is also readying Edge, a dedicated HTML5 animation tool that promises to make it easy to create Flash-style animation.</p>

    <h2>Where can I see some HTML5 demos?</h2>
    <p id="cuatro">The cunningly named HTML5demos.com has some good demonstrations, along with a key showing which ones work in which browsers, while the excellent HTML5rocks.com has both demos and code samples for designers and developers. Google has put together an HTML5 video player for YouTube , and Apple has put together an HTML5 showcase on Apple.com. Our favourite, though, is the interactive film Chris Milk made for Arcade Fire's We Used To Wait.</p>
